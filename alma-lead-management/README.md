# Project Guide: Next.js Application
This guide provides an overview of the project, setup instructions, and links to helpful resources. It complements the existing project setup documentation.
## Overview
This project utilizes **Next.js** to create a modern, fast, and responsive web application. Next.js offers features like automatic server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and seamless routing. This project also includes advanced optimizations like modular CSS styling, image optimization, and a global state management setup.
## Setup Guide
Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local system.
### Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. Run the following command in the terminal to install the required dependencies:
``` bash
npm install
# or use yarn if preferred
yarn install
```
### Run in Development Mode
After installing dependencies, you can start the development server using one of these commands:
``` bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
Once the server starts, open your browser and visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app.
## Editing the Application
You can start editing the project by modifying the source files. For example, editing the main page can be done by altering:
- **`app/page.tsx` **: This is the main entry point for the frontend interface. Any changes made in this file will automatically reload in the browser.

## Font Optimization
This project integrates [](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts)`next/font` to optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a premium font family provided by Vercel. This ensures fast and consistent text rendering.

## Deployment Instructions
The application can be deployed with ease using the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com):
1. Visit the [Vercel Deployment Page](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme).
2. Import the repository and follow the steps to deploy your project.

Alternatively, build your application for deployment locally using this command:
``` bash
npm run build
```
This will optimize the app for production. You can then preview the build by running:
``` bash
npm start
```
For more information, check the [Next.js deployment guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying).
